The repository provides a fully functional multithreaded multi connection Email server, which works asynchronously in a thread pool, accepts the POP3, IMAP, and SMTP connections, delivers E-mails via the SMTP protocol, and relays outgoing E-mails to end-recipients across the Web. The SSL/TLS encryption is available, as well.   

Please [Read the Article](https://www.clevercomponents.com/articles/article051/), which describes how to implement a multi-session e-mail server in Delphi, using server components from the [Clever Internet Suite](https://www.clevercomponents.com/products/inetsuite/) library.
